City Scape

Our project is a visually stunning cityscape created using the power of OpenGL, a popular graphics library for computer programming. Through the use of transformations, animation, and primitive creation functions, we have built a dynamic cityscape that comes to life with two distinct views - that of the morning and evening. The project showcases our creativity and technical expertise in bringing a virtual city to life on the computer screen.
One of the highlights of our cityscape project is the realistic depiction of the changing time of day. By utilizing the upper arrow key on the keyboard, we have implemented a feature that allows users to seamlessly transition between a morning view and an evening view. This feature brings an immersive experience to our cityscape, with the background color changing from a serene morning palette to a vibrant and warm evening ambiance. The smooth transition of colors adds a touch of realism to our virtual city, making it a captivating visual experience for the users.
Another notable aspect of our project is the dynamic movement of objects within the cityscape. We have animated cars that move along the roads, giving the city a sense of bustling activity. Additionally, we have incorporated moving clouds in the sky, adding a realistic touch to the overall atmosphere. These animations create a sense of dynamism and liveliness in our cityscape, making it more engaging and interactive for users.
Our project also demonstrates our mastery of OpenGL's primitive creation functions, which we have utilized to create various elements of the cityscape. From buildings and roads to cars and clouds, we have carefully crafted each object using OpenGL's capabilities, showcasing our attention to detail and creative design skills. The use of transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling has enabled us to create a visually appealing and realistic cityscape that captures the essence of an urban setting.
In conclusion, our cityscape project is a testament to our technical prowess and creative ingenuity in utilizing OpenGL to create a visually captivating and dynamic virtual environment. The morning and evening views, the changing background colors, the animated cars, and the moving clouds all come together to create a realistic and immersive cityscape experience. We are proud of our achievement in bringing our vision to life and presenting a compelling project that showcases our skills in graphics programming using OpenGL.
